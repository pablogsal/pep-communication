Abstract
========

What this PEP Does Not Cover
============================

- Communications beyond CPython core development (language and processes)
- Communication mediums not maintained by CPython core devs or the PSF

What the PEP Does Cover
=======================

- Current communication mediums both formally adopted ones and trial efforts
- User personas
- Historical evolution of Python Communications
- Current Communication Mediums
- Detailed look at different Communication Mediums
- Information Types (Text, Visual, Audio / Video)
- 


Principles about Change
=======================

- Change is a reality. Change is neither completely good or bad. Change
  is driven by the current practices in software development and the
  community of CPython developers.
- Each person should expect some change to their existing workflow.
- While changes may require some learning of new tools or methods,
  time needed to do so should be respected and not be overly
  burdensome as we are volunteers.
- Changes should clarify existing processes or practices.

Personas for Communication
==========================

The following user personas identify the typical uses of communication
tool:

- Python users
- Third party library or package maintainer
    - example: core maintainer on another busy project, only wishes to have information on a particular topic instead of a firehose of information
- CPython contributor
    - example: someone completely new to the project, how do they become invested over time
- CPython core developer

Historical Evolution of Python Communication Mediums
====================================================

This list summarizes the history of Python core development
communication mediums (ordered from oldest to most recent usage):

- Mailing Lists / Usenet(?)
- IRC
- Documentation / wiki
- Issue trackers
- python.org website
- Dev Guide
- GitHub PR Discussion
- Zulip
- Discourse (discuss.python.org)

Currently Used Communication Mediums
====================================

- DevGuide
- PEPs
- Mailing List History
- IRC History
- Zulip History
- Discourse History
- Personal blogs/posts
- bugs.python.org
- python.org


Modes of Communication - Pros and Limitations
=============================================

Mailing Lists
-------------

Limitations
^^^^^^^^^^^
- subtle bias towards a "long-term investment" persona: when joining a mailing list, it's very difficult to join a discussion already-in-progress. The only people who get the privilege of replying to a post are the people who subscribed before the post was made.
- firehose of information can overwhelm new contributors and potentially discourage them away from the project

Information Types
=================

Communication mediums used for Python development should support
both **textual** information and **visual** information. Audio and video
information is also usseful but is outside the scope of this PEP.

The following sections will point out some of the benefits and
limitations of sharing each type of information.

Text
----

Text based communication, such as mailing lists, has been the bulk of
information shared in the past as well as currently.

Visual
------

The importance of communicating visual information has increased markedly
due to the modern editors, JavaScript, and tools such as Jupyter notebooks.
Communication mediums should have the ability to archive, link out to
persistant storage, or inline visual information.

Audio and Video
---------------

While audio and video are not typically used to communicate information about
Python core development, it's a possibility that workgroups or affinity groups
may choose to use webinars or group chats. This PEP flags the potential future
use but defers any recommendations and workflows related to audio and video
to future PEPs.

Types of Communication
======================

Announcements
-------------

Where should announcements be made?

Decisions
~~~~~~~~~

Where should decisions be communicated? PEPs

Informational
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Where should event, meeting, and requests for comments be communicated?

Discussion
----------

- Where should discussions take place?
- Should different communication mediums be used for different types of discussion?
- Brief q and a; working collaboration on a specific task or project; brainstorming ideas

Detailed Visualizations of Current Communications Options
=========================================================

These visualization and mappings should identify what is currently in use and potential
suggestions for the future.

Usage Metrics for Current Communications Options
================================================

Discourse (discuss.python.org) `Site statistics <https://discuss.python.org/about>`_

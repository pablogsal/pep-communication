Abstract
========

What this PEP Does Not Cover
============================

- Communications beyond CPython core development (language and processes)
- Communication mediums not maintained by CPython core devs or the PSF

What the PEP Does Cover
=======================

- Current communication mediums both formally adopted ones and trial efforts
- User personas

Principles about Change
=======================

- Change is a reality. Change is neither completely good or bad. Change
  is driven by the current practices in software development and the
  community of CPython developers.
- Each person should expect some change to their existing workflow.
- While changes may require some learning of new tools or methods,
  time needed to do so should be respected and not be overly
  burdensome as we are volunteers.
- Changes should clarify existing processes or practices.
